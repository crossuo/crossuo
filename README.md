# CrossUO Client

[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crossuo/crossuo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/crossuo/crossuo)
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/t7rtpwwv6m0fguc4?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/fungos/crossuo)

CrossUO is a cross-platform Ultima Online client in active development.

Current supported platforms:

- Windows 7+
- Linux
- MacOSX

> Note for Linux users wanting to use X:UO Assist, Qt5 with multimedia and script support is required:
> `sudo apt install qtmultimedia5-dev qtscript5-dev`

In development:

- RaspberryPi (working, but low fps)
- Web Browser via Webassembly (in progress)

**Currently CrossUO renderer is based on an old OpenGL 1 implementation that is being (slowly) fully reworked. This will enable yet more platforms and huge boost on graphical performance.**
